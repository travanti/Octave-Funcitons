Convolution Octave (matlab) function file
Created by N. Travnati

---------------------------------------------
This funciton was created as part of an assignemnt for EE 510 machine Learning class at PSU.

The intent was for this function to take two (assumed) well behaved inputs and convolve them.
Well behaved includes the following assumptions:
1) that the two vecorized input signals are of the same dimension,
2) that the sizes of the files in question are small enough to be handled by Octave's (matlab's) standard memory allocation values.

This software has been compared to preformance for the standard octave library's conv fucntion for output. And while that function is
likely more optimized and easily used the intent for developing this function was to give the author experience using linear algebra techniques
implementing practical solutions with matrix mapping.

This software is free to use distribute and use as wished and is offered with no liscense or guarentee by the author.
